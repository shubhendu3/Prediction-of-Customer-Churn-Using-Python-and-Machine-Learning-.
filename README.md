# Prediction-of-Customer-Churn-Using-Python-and-Machine-Learning-.
The purpose of this seminar to employ Machine Learning by creating a predictive model that predicts customer 
churn. 
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is 
seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on 
sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly 
programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email 
filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the 
needed tasks. Therefore, I decided to explore different Machine learning algorithms and techniques to incorporate 
in my customer churn predictive model. 
Customer churn analysis and prediction in telecom sector is an issue now a days because it's very important for 
telecommunication industries to analyze behaviors of various customer to predict which customers are about to 
leave the subscription from telecom company. So data mining techniques and algorithm plays an important role 
for companies in todays commercial conditions because gaining a new customer's cost is more than retaining the 
existing ones. 
The broad objective of this project is to create a customer churn prediction model using Telco Customer churn 
dataset. I used binary classification to model churned customers, pandas for data crunching and mat-plot-lib for 
visualizations. We will do all of that above in Python. The code can be used with another data-set with a few minor 
adjustments to train the baseline model. 
This problem statement falls under the domain of Machine learning. Incorporating Machine learning techniques 
in this project was quite easy. I used logistic regression and binary classifier to train and test my model. The dataset I used was the Telco Customer Churn data-set that was available on Kaggle website.
